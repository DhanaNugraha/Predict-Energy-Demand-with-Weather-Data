# Model Evaluation Report

## 1. Actual vs Predicted Time Series
**Visualization**: Line plot comparing actual (blue) and predicted (orange) energy demand over time.

**Key Insights**:
- Tracks model performance across the test period
- Identifies specific time periods where predictions deviate from actuals
- Shows if the model captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Close alignment between lines indicates good predictive performance
- Consistent over-prediction or under-prediction suggests model bias
- Large deviations may indicate missing features or external factors not accounted for

## 2. Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
**Visualization**: Scatter plot with actual values on x-axis and predicted values on y-axis.

**Key Insights**:
- Measures precision of predictions across different demand levels
- Reveals if prediction errors increase with higher demand
- Shows distribution of prediction accuracy

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Points clustered tightly around the red line (perfect prediction) indicate high accuracy
- Curved patterns suggest non-linear relationships not captured by the model
- Fan-shaped patterns indicate heteroscedasticity (varying error magnitude)

## 3. Residual Plot
**Visualization**: Residuals (actual - predicted) plotted against predicted values.

**Key Insights**:
- Checks if model errors are randomly distributed
- Identifies patterns in prediction errors
- Reveals if the model has consistent bias at different prediction levels

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Random scatter around y=0 is ideal
- Patterns (curves, funnels) suggest model misspecification
- Increasing spread indicates heteroscedasticity

## 4. Hourly Pattern
**Visualization**: Average actual and predicted load by hour of day.

**Key Insights**:
- How well the model captures daily demand patterns
- Identifies specific hours where predictions are less accurate
- Shows if the model understands peak and off-peak periods

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Close alignment shows good capture of daily patterns
- Consistent over/under prediction at certain hours suggests missing temporal features
- Differences in peak timing or magnitude highlight model limitations

## 5. Day of Week Pattern
**Visualization**: Average actual and predicted load by day of week.

**Key Insights**:
- Model's ability to capture weekly seasonality
- Differences in prediction quality between weekdays and weekends
- Identifies specific days where the model struggles

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Close alignment shows good capture of weekly patterns
- Larger deviations on weekends might indicate different usage patterns
- Consistent bias on certain days suggests missing weekly features

## 6. Feature Importance
**Visualization**: Horizontal bar chart showing relative importance of each feature.

**Key Insights**:
- Which features are most influential in predictions
- Identifies redundant or unimportant features
- Helps in feature selection for model optimization

**Interpretation Guide**:
- Top features likely include recent load values (lag features)
- Time-based features (hour, day_of_week) should have reasonable importance
- Features with near-zero importance might be candidates for removal

## Performance Metrics
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Lower values indicate better fit (in the same units as the target)
- **RÂ² (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained (0-1, higher is better)

## Recommendations
1. **Model Improvement**:
   - Add interaction terms if residuals show patterns
   - Consider non-linear models if relationships appear curved
   - Include additional temporal features (holidays, seasons)

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Focus on improving important features
   - Consider adding moving averages or other rolling statistics
   - Include weather forecast data if available

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Cross-validate performance across different time periods
   - Test model on out-of-sample data
   - Consider ensemble methods if prediction errors are systematic
